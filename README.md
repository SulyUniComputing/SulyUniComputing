### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**SulyUniComputing/SulyUniComputing** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Created a client-side only website for the student' union online shop.
This was part of assessment 1 for the Interactive applications module.

The assignment used advanced knowledge of html, css and javascript. I found manipulating the elemnts via css the most difficult as alot of the styling was trial and error. The code has been commented on important lines of code so the user understands what is happening.

I also struggled with the responsive side of css styling however i managed to get the product cards responsive in the products page. However, I enjoyed and understood using javascript when manipulatign array loops and using sessionStorage
